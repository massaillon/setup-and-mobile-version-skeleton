## Usage

    In the nineth milestone of our portfolio website, we will:

    - We will implement a client-side validation of the data in the contact form before submission.


    We need to implement a simple validation:

          - The content of the email field has to be in lower case.

    We should implement the following interactions:

          - When the user submits the form, you check if the email is in lower case.
          - If the validation is OK, the form is sent.
          - If the validation is not OK, you show an error message to the user near the submit button informing them of the error and the form is not sent.
