Project Name

    Setup and Mobile Version Skeleton

Built With

    - HTML
    - CSS

Prerequisites

    * For this project, you should use the HTML&CSS linter

    * The 4 sections you need to build for this project are:
        
        - the toolbar section
        - the headline section
        - works section
        - about myself section

        - In order to lay out the elements on the page we should use Flexbox in all 2 first sections and combine CSS grid and flexbox for the other 2 sections.

        - We don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like opening the menu or creating dropdowns.

        - We must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, tests, margins) using the templates in Figma.

        - Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
