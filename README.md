Project Name

    Setup and Mobile Version Skeleton

Built With

    - HTML
    - CSS

Prerequisites

    For the third milestone of our portfolio website, we will:

        - Add a contact form to your portfolio and the portfolio of your coding partner.

        - Make sure that you guide your users' experience in a way that helps them fill in the form without frustration.


        - In order to lay out the elements on the page we should use Flexbox in all 2 first sections and combine CSS grid and flexbox for the other 2 sections.

        - We don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like opening the menu or creating dropdowns.

        - We must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, tests, margins) using the templates in Figma.

        - Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
